              If text is set ragged right, the word space <span class="bracket">(</span>the space between words<span class="bracket">)</span> can be fixed and unchanging. If the text is justified <span class="bracket">(</span>set flush left and right<span class="bracket">)</span>, the word space must be elastic. In either case the size of the ideal word space varies from one circumstance to another, depending on factors such as letterfit, type color, and size. A loosely fitted or bold face will need a larger interval between the words. At larger sizes, when letterfit is tightened, the spacing of words can be tightened as well.”

          </blockquote>
          <p>
            In <abbr>CSS</abbr>, word space is set with the <code>word-spacing</code> property which has a default value of <code>normal</code>. The default word space is equivalent to approximately 0.25 em, although the exact value will depend on information encoded within the digital font file. To change the word spacing, you should specify a length in ems. This length is added to the existing word space; that is to say <code>word-spacing</code> does not set the actual space between words, it sets an increment to the existing spacing. For example: 
          </p>
          <pre data-lang="CSS"><code>p {
  word-spacing: 0.25em;
}

h1 {
  word-spacing: -0.125em;
}</code></pre>
          <p>
            In the preceding example, word space in paragraphs is increased by 0.25 em (effectively doubling it) and the word space in top level headings is decreased by 0.125 em (effectively halving it).
          </p>
          <p>
            While in theory you could specify <code>word-spacing</code> in pixels or any other allowable unit of length, it is important to specify <code>word-spacing</code> in ems as that is the only way to guarantee the word space changes proportionately to the text size (when readers change their default text size, for example).
          </p>
          <h3>
            An explanation of ems
          </h3>
          <p>
            Ems are so-called because they are thought to approximate the size of an uppercase letter M (and so are pronounced "emm"), although 1 em is actually significantly larger than this. Bringhurst describes the em thus:
          </p>
          <blockquote>
            <div>
              <span class="bracket">[</span>t<span class="bracket">]</span>he em is a sliding measure. One em is a distance equal to the type size. In 6 point type, an em is 6 points; in 12 point type an em is 12 points and in 60 point type an em is 60 points. Thus a one em space is proportionately the same in any size.
            </div>
          </blockquote>
          <p>
            To illustrate this principle in terms of <abbr>CSS</abbr>, consider these styles:
          </p>
          <pre data-lang="CSS"><code>#box1 {
  font-size: 12px;
  width: 1em;
  height: 1em;
  border: 1px solid black;
}
            
#box2 {
  font-size: 60px;
  width: 1em;
  height: 1em;
  border: 1px solid black;
}</code></pre>
          <p>
            These styles will render like: 
          </p>
          <figure>
            <div id="example-1">M</div>
            <div id="example-2">M</div>
          </figure>
          <p>
            Note that both boxes have a height and width of 1 em but because they have different font sizes, one box is bigger than the other. Box 1 has a <code class="inline-code">font-size</code> of 12 px so its width and height is also 12 px; similarly the text of box 2 is set to 60 px and so its width and height are also 60 px.

For multiple column work, a better average is 40 to 50 characters.”

          <p>
            The <i>measure</i> is the number of characters in a single line of a column of text. <abbr>HTML</abbr> doesn’t have a concept of columns per se, instead text is held within <i>boxes</i>. In <abbr>CSS</abbr> the width of a box is set using the <code>width</code> property with any unit of length, for example:
          </p>
          <pre data-lang="CSS"><code>#col1 {
  width: 400px;
}

#col2 {
  width: 50%;
}

#col3 {
  width:33em;
}</code></pre>
          <p>
            When typographers set the measure and text size for printed media, those dimensions are fixed and unchangeable in their physical manifestation. In this regard, the Web as viewed on-screen is fundamentally different to print because the medium is far more under the control of your readers. In particular, if your reader wishes to change the text size or the dimensions of the ‘page’, they can do.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the preceding example, column 1 has a fixed width: it has been set to 400 px wide. With text rendering at 12 px this would result in a measure of approximately 66 characters per line. If your reader increases the text size to 16 px then the measure reduces to 50 characters per line. Thus when the text size is changed, so the measure changes.
          </p>
          <p>
            Column 2 has a liquid width: it has been set to 50% wide. Assuming your reader is browsing with a window 1000 px wide, the box would be rendered as 500 px wide, resulting in a measure of about 83 characters per line. A measure of 83 may be a little too wide for your reader, but because the box is liquid, your reader could reduce their window size to 800 px, thus narrowing the box to 400 px and creating a more comfortable measure of 66 characters per line.
          </p>
          <p>
            Column 3 has an elastic width: it has been set to 33 em wide. On average one character takes up 0.5 em so this box will have a measure of 66 characters per line. If your reader increases the text size, the width of box will increase accordingly and so the measure remains at 66 regardless of the text size.
          </p>
          <p>
            From a typographical perspective, the most appropriate method is to set box width in ems (elastic layout) as it ensures the measure is always set to the typographer’s specification. Setting box width as a percentage (liquid layout) gives the typographer approximate control over measure but also allows the reader to adjust the layout to suit their comfort. This website has been designed with liquid layout to afford readers this control.
          </p>
          <p>
    Relinquishing such control makes some designers quake in their boots, but the beauty and advantage of the Web as a medium is that readers are able to adjust their reading environment to suit their own needs. This is a concept that should be acknowledged & embraced, and built into website designs from the ground up.

                In justified text, there is always a trade-off between evenness of word spacing and frequency of hyphenation.
              </p>
              <p>
                Narrow measures – which prevent good justification – are commonly used when the text is set in multiple columns. Setting ragged right under these conditions will lighten the page and decrease its stiffness.
              </p>
              <p>
                Many unserifed faces look best when set ragged no matter what the length of the measure. And mono-spaced fonts, which are common on typewriters, always look better set ragged.”

          <p>
            Setting text justified or ragged is accomplished in <abbr>CSS</abbr> through the <code class="inline">text-align</code> property, as follows: 
          </p>
          <pre data-lang="CSS"><code>p {
  text-align: left; /* ragged right */
}

p {
  text-align: right; /* ragged left */
}

p {
  text-align: justify;
}</code></pre>
          <p>
            Effective justification of text can only be achieved if long words are hyphenated. <abbr>HTML</abbr> and <abbr>CSS 2</abbr> do not have any provision for automatic hyphenation and current Web browsers support, even for manual hyphenation, is poor.
          </p>
          <p>
            So don’t justify text on the web.
          </p>
          <h3>
            Future considerations
          </h3>
          <p>
            <abbr>CSS3</abbr> provides further refinement of justification within the <a class="ext-link" href="https://www.w3.org/TR/css3-text">Text Module</a>. For European languages, the <code>text-justify</code> property provides two justification options: <code>inter-word</code> and <code>inter-character</code>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Setting <code>inter-word</code> selects the simplest and fastest full justification behaviour, which spreads the text evenly across the line by increasing the width of the space between words only. No expansion or compression occurs within the words, i.e. no additional letter spacing is created.
          </p>
          <p>
            Setting <code>inter-character</code> selects the justification behaviour in which both inter-word and inter-letter spacing can be expanded or reduced to spread the text across the whole line. This is the significantly slower and more sophisticated type of the full justify behaviour preferred in newspaper and magazines. Typically, compression is tried first. If unsuccessful, expansion occurs: inter-word spaces are expanded up to a threshold, and finally inter-letter expansion is performed. For example:
          </p>
          <pre data-lang="CSS"><code>p {
  text-align: justify;
  text-justify: inter-character;
}</code></pre>
          <p>
            <abbr>CSS3</abbr> also provides last line alignment with the <code>text-align-last</code> property. Normally the last line in a paragraph of justified text would not be justified, however if <code>text-align-last</code> is set to <code>justify</code> then the last line will be also spread evenly across the line, although in most cases this would be highly undesirable from a typographical perspective.
          </p>
          <p>
            A potentially more useful purpose for <code>text-align-last</code>, at least for display text, is to set it to <code>size</code>. With <code class="inline">size</code> selected, the line content is scaled to fit on the line, so a line with fewer characters will be displayed in a larger font.

              In the nineteenth century, which was a dark and inflationary age in typography and type design, many compositors were encouraged to stuff extra space between sentences. Generations of twentieth century typists were then taught to do the same, by hitting the spacebar twice after every period <span class="bracket">[</span>full stop<span class="bracket">]</span>. Your typing as well as your typesetting will benefit from unlearning this quaint Victorian habit. As a general rule, no more than a single space is required after a period, colon or any other mark of punctuation.”

          <p>
            All white space in <abbr>HTML</abbr>, in any combination of spaces, tabs or line breaks, is automatically collapsed to a single word space. Therefore this guideline is automatically adhered to regardless of your training as a typist.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you do need to insert more than a single word space between sentences, or any other characters, then use one of the many <a class="ext-link" href="https://www.alanwood.net/unicode/general_punctuation.html" target="_blank">space characters available in Unicode</a>. Even if the character itself isn’t included in the current font, Unicode-aware browsers will display a good approximation. Avoid the temptation to use a non-breaking space, <code>&amp;nbsp;</code>, as this has a meaning in and of itself.

            Another method would be to apply the <code>white-space:pre</code> property in <abbr>CSS</abbr> to retain the white space formatting. However if you are using white space to format a passage of text, for instance computer code or poetry, then you should enclose the passage in a <code>pre</code> element as this is a more semantic way to preserve the white space pre-formatting.

            Letter spacing in <abbr>CSS</abbr> is achieved with the aptly named <code>letter-spacing</code> property. To letter space abbreviations at 10% of the type size you could wrap the abbreviations in <code>&lt;abbr&gt;</code> tags and apply a <abbr>CSS</abbr> rule such as:

At this point your <abbr>CMS</abbr> developer would probably turn to regular expressions.

            I’m not going to explain regular expressions here – there are plenty of resources elsewhere on the web – but in the form of a <abbr>PHP</abbr> function here is an expression to get you started:
          </p>
          <pre data-lang="PHP"><code>$search = '/\b([A-Z][A-Z0-9]{2,})\b/';
$replace = '&lt;abbr&gt;$1&lt;/abbr&gt;';
$text = preg_replace($search,$replace,$text);</code></pre>
          <p>
            This function looks for sequences of 3 or more uppercase letters or numbers, such as <abbr>CSS</abbr>, <abbr>HTML</abbr> and <abbr>W3C</abbr>, and wraps an <code>&lt;abbr&gt;</code> tag around them.

              A man who would letterspace lower case would steal sheep, Frederic Goudy liked to say. The reason for not letterspacing lower case is that it hampers legibility. But there are some lowercase alphabets to which this principle doesn’t apply. Moderate letterspacing can make a face such as lowercase Univers bold condensed <em>more</em> legible rather than less.”
            </p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>
            Letterspacing lower case on the Web is particularly risky as only some faces actually benefit from the treatment, and you can rarely guarantee which type face you will actually be transforming.
          </p>
          <p>
            There are however some fairly common typefaces to which letterspacing could be applied. Vaguely similar to the Univers bold condensed mentioned by Bringhurst are Impact and Haettenschweiler. These faces would only be used for headings and could be letterspaced using the <code>letter-spacing</code> property as follows:
          </p>
          <pre data-lang="CSS"><code>h2 {
  font-family: "univers bold condensed", impact, haettenschweiler, sans-serif;
  font-size: 200%;
  letter-spacing: 0.1em;
}</code></pre>
          <p>
            This would render as follows:
          </p>
          <figure id="example-3">

            </p>
          </figure>
          <p>
            Notice that the <code>letter-spacing</code> is specified in <code>ems</code> to ensure that the amount of kerning is applied in proportion to the text size.

            </p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>
            At present there is no mechanism within <abbr>HTML</abbr> or <abbr>CSS</abbr> that specifically enables kerning. However text on the Web does not generally need manual kerning, as all digital fonts have kerning tables built-in. These tables define which letter pairs need adjusting and by how much, and are usually adhered to by operating systems. The only time manual kerning may prove necessary is with larger text such as that in headings, in particular when numbers, italics or punctuation are involved.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is also important to bear in mind that letter pairs in one font of your <code class="inline">font-family</code> list may need kerning whereas in another font they do not. In this case it is advisable not to kern, as too much kerning is almost always worse than none at all.
          </p>
          <p>
            Where you do wish to kern letter pairs, you must insert a neutral inline element, such as <code>span</code> and apply the <code>letter-spacing</code> property. For example:
          </p>
          <pre data-lang="HTML"><code>&lt;span class="kern">W&lt;/span&gt;ashington and &lt;span class="kern">T&lt;/span&gt;oronto</pre></code>
          <pre data-lang="CSS"><code>.kern {
  letter-spacing: -0.1em;
}</pre></code>
          <p>
            Which should render as:
          </p>
          <figure id="example-4">
            <p>
              <span class="kerning">W</span>ashington and <span class="kerning">T</span>oronto
            </p>
          </figure>
          <p>
            Notice that the <code>span</code> was applied around the first letter of the pair, not around both letters. This is because the <code>letter-spacing</code> property adds or removes space <strong>after each letter</strong>. Notice also that the <code>letter-spacing</code> is specified in <code>ems</code> to ensure that the amount of kerning is applied in proportion to the text size.
            </p>
            <p>
    As with <a class="ext-link" href="#Letterspace_all_strings_of_capitals_and_small_caps,_and_all_long_strings_of_digits">letterspacing strings of capitals</a>, adding a <code>span</code> every time you need to kern a letter pair could become tedious and so regular expressions could come to the rescue once more. This <abbr>PHP</abbr> function uses a regular expression to replace insert a <code>span</code> into any string of ‘To’ or ‘Wa’:
          </p>
          <pre data-lang="PHP"><code>$search = '/(T)(o)|(W)(a)/';
$replace = '&lt;span class="kern"&gt;$1$3&lt;/span&gt;$2$4';
$text = preg_replace($search,$replace,$text);</pre></code>

          </blockquote>
          <p>
            <abbr>CSS</abbr> does not offer many opportunities for altering the width or shapes of letters. In fact only the <code>letter-spacing</code> property can be applied at all for this purpose, and that simply changes the width of the letters (but not their shape). The <code>letter-spacing</code> property can however be particularly destructive. Consider this maltreatment of a heading:
          </p>
          <pre data-lang="HTML"><code>&lt;h2 class="squish"&gt;letterfit&lt;/h2&gt;</code></pre>
          <pre data-lang="CSS"><code>h2.squish {
  letter-spacing: -0.1em;
}</code></pre>
          <p>Resulting in:</p>
          <figure id="example-5">
            <p>
              Letterfit is important
            </p>
          </figure>
          <p>
            The result may differentiate itself stylistically from other websites, and that might be fine if the words are not important; legibility is the real loser in this instance.

            The <i>dot leader</i> approach to which Bringhurst alludes is the default presentation for tables of contents in Microsoft Word. Fortunately this kind of layout is tricky to accomplish in <abbr>CSS</abbr> so it is rarely seen in web pages. Bringhurst goes on to present two alternative layouts for tables of contents which are replicated here:
          </p>
          <h3>
            Example 1 – Table of contents aligned right
          </h3>
          <figure>
            <table id="example-6">
              <tbody>
                <tr>
                  <th>Introduction</th>
                  <td>7</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                  <th>Chapter <strong>1</strong> The Sex of Centaurs</th>
                  <td>11</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                  <th>Chapter <strong>2</strong> Poliphilo&#8217;s Dream</th>
                  <td>11</td>
                </tr>
              </tbody>
            </table>
          </figure>
          <p>
            This is a table of contents so it has been marked up as a simple table:
          </p>
          <pre data-lang="HTML"><code>&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;th>Introduction&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;td>7&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;th&gt;
      Chapter &lt;strong>1&lt;/strong&gt;
      The Sex of Centaurs
    &lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;11&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;th&gt;
      Chapter &lt;strong&gt;2&lt;/strong&gt;
      Poliphilo&amp;#8217;s Dream
    &lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;11&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;</code></pre>
          <p>
            The CSS looks like this:
          </p>
          <pre data-lang="CSS"><code>table {
  margin: 0 3em 0 auto;
}

th {
  font-weight: normal;
  text-align: right;
  padding: 0;
}

td {
  font-style: italic;
  text-align: right;
  padding: 0 0 0 0.5em;
}</code></pre>
          <p>
            While most of the <abbr>CSS</abbr> is straight forward, a point worth highlighting is the <code>margin</code> declaration for the <code>table</code> itself. There is a right margin of 3 em to set the table in slightly from the right gutter and a left margin of <code>auto</code> to push the table over towards the right hand side of the page.
          </p>
          <h3>
            Example 2 – Centred table of contents
          </h3>
          <figure>
            <table id="example-7">
              <tbody>
                <tr>
                  <th>Prologue</th>
                  <td>page 5</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                  <th>Points of Possible Agreement</th>
                  <td>page 9</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                  <th>Irreconcilable Differences</th>
                  <td>page 11</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                  <th>Conclusion</th>
                  <td>page 163</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                  <th>Index</th>
                  <td>page 164</td>
                </tr>
              </tbody>
            </table>
          </figure>
          <p>
            Again a simple table has been used for the markup:
          </p>
          <pre data-lang="HTML"><code>&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;th&gt;Prologue&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;page 5&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;th&gt;Points of Possible Agreement&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;page 9&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;th&gt;Irreconcilable Differences&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;page 11&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;th&gt;Conclusion&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;page 163&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;th&gt;Index&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;page 164&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;</code></pre>
          <p>
            The <abbr>CSS</abbr> looks like this:
          </p>
          <pre data-lang="CSS"><code>table {
  margin: 0 auto;
}

th {
  font-weight: normal;
  text-align: right;
  padding: 0 0.5em 0 0;
}

td:before {
  content: "\2022";
  padding-right: 0.5em;
}

td {
  font-style: italic;
  text-align: left;
  padding: 0;
}</code></pre>
          <p>
            There a couple of points worth noting in the <abbr>CSS</abbr>. The table has been centered by giving the left and right margins a value of <code>auto</code>. For block-level elements a <code>width</code> declaration would also be required when applying this technique, however tables have an inherent width so one does not need to be specified explicitly.
          </p>
          <p>
            The bullet points separating chapter titles and page numbers have been generated by the <abbr>CSS</abbr>. Specifically a bullet point (Unicode character 2022) has been inserted before the <code>td</code> element. Generated content is not supported by Internet Explorer 6 or 7, so a more cross-browser alternative would be to write a bullet point entity <code>&amp;#8226;</code> into the markup itself.

You must choose not only the overall measure – the depth of the column or page – but also a basic rhythmical unit. This unit is the leading, which is the distance from one baseline to the next.”
            </p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>
            Leading (pronounced “ledding”) is so called because, in mechanical presses, strips of lead are placed between lines of type to space the lines apart. Leading is achieved in <abbr>CSS</abbr> through the <code>line-height</code> property. For example 12 point text can be given 3 points of lead in the following manner:
          </p>
          <pre pre data-lang="CSS"><code>p {
  font-size: 12pt;
  line-height: 15pt;
}</code></pre>
          <p>
            That example will give you the same line-height throughout all your paragraphs, however it does introduce the danger that, when the browser text size is increased by your reader (to 18 pt for example) the line-height may remain at 15 pt. The result being that, instead of the lines being spaced apart, they would actually overlap.
          </p>
          <p>
            A safer approach is to use a unitless value. The preceding example could also be coded as:
          </p>
          <pre pre data-lang="CSS"><code>p {
  font-size: 12pt;
  line-height: 1.25;
}</code></pre>
          <p>
            In this example the value of <code>line-height</code> is a multiplier: 1.25 x 12 = 15 pt. This is a far more reliable method as the line-height (the distance between baselines) will always be proportional to the text size. Line height can be incorporated into the <code>font</code> property using a shorthand familiar to typographers:
          </p>
          <pre pre data-lang="CSS"><code>p {
  font: 12pt/1.25 "Minion Pro", "Minion Web", serif;
}</code></pre>
          <p>
            It should be noted that some browsers add a little leading by default: Safari and Internet Explorers for example; whereas others, such as Camino and Firefox, do not. Text on the web almost always benefits from an increase in line height, and figures upwards of 1.3 are common (this page has a <code>line-height</code> of 1.5 for example).
          </p>
          <p>
            Unlike in mechanical presses, where one line of lead is added below the text, the spacing added on the Web is divided equally above and below the text. To illustrate this the following example has a <code>line-height</code> of 3 and shows the text set midway between two borders:
          </p>
          <figure id="example-14">
            <p>
              line-height spacing is added equally above and below the text
            </p>
          </figure>
          <p>
            Negative leading, in other words a <code>line-height</code> value of less than 1, can be used on short pieces of text provided care is taken to ensure ascenders and descenders do not collide. For example:
          </p>
          <pre data-lang="CSS"><code>.example {
  font-size: 1.5em;
  line-height: 0.85;
  text-indent: -0.5em;
}</code></pre>
          <figure id="example-13">
            <p>
              this is an example
              <br/>
    of negative leading
            </p>

These variations can and should add life to the page, but the main text should also return after each variation precisely on beat and in phase.”
            </p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>
            The most common addition of vertical space on a webpage is that inserted between paragraphs. If the rhythm of the page is to be maintained, the spacing of paragraphs should be related to the basic leading. For example, the text on this page is set at 12 px with a <code>line-height</code> of 1.5 em, making each line 18 px in height. In order to keep the rhythm of the text, the vertical spacing between blocks should also be 18 px. This is achieved by setting top- and bottom-margins equal to the line height.
          </p>
          <pre data-lang="CSS"><code>p {
  line-height: 1.5;
  margin-top: 1.5em;
  margin-bottom: 1.5em;
}</code></pre>
          <p>
            It should be noted that the default treatment by web browsers of paragraphs (and other block level elements such as blockquotes and lists) is to insert a top- and bottom-margin of 1 em. The implication is that margins must always be specified by the designer.
          </p>
          <h3>
            Variations in text size
          </h3>
          <p>
            When there is a change in text size, perhaps with a heading or sidenotes, the differing text should take up a multiple of the basic leading. As stated earlier, each line on this page is 18 px in height. This means that every diversion from the basic text size should take up multiples of 18 px. This can be accomplished by adjusting the <code>line-height</code> and <code>margin</code> accordingly.
          </p>
          <h3>
            Headings
          </h3>
          <p>
            The subheadings on this page are set to 14 px. In order that the height of each line is 18 px, the <code>line-height</code> should be set to 18 ÷ 14 = 1.286. Similarly the margins above and below the heading must be adjusted. The temptation is to set heading margins to a simple 1 em, or leave them at the browser default, but this would usually result in breaking the rhythm of the text. In the case of this page, the top and bottom margins are the same size and equal to a full line, so they too should be set at 1.286 em.
          </p>
          <pre data-lang="CSS"><code>h2 {
  line-height: 1.286;
  margin-top: 1.286em;
  margin-bottom: 1.286em;
}</code></pre>
          <p>
            One can also set asymmetrical margins for headings, provided the margins combine to be multiples of the basic line height. For example, a top margin of 1½ lines could be combined with a bottom margin of half a line as follows:
          </p>
          <figure>
            <img src="https://webtypography.net/i/2-2-2i.png" alt="Diagram of text showing how the basic leading is retained with a heading and asymmetrical margins">
          </figure>
          <pre data-lang="CSS"><code>h2 {
  line-height: 1.286;
  margin-top: 1.929em;
  margin-bottom: 0.643em;
}</code></pre>
          <p>
            By way of a further example, the main heading of the page you are reading has a text size of 18 px, therefore the <code>line-height</code> is set to 1 em, as are the margins.
          </p>
          <h3>
            Sidenotes
          </h3>
          <p>
            Sidenotes (and footnotes for that matter) are often set at a smaller size to the basic text. This smaller text should still form a rhythm with the basic text, so a calculation similar to that of headings, is required. Consider the following example:
          </p>
          <figure id="example-8">
            <p class="sidenote">
              The forecastledeck is the short deck that, towards the ship’s bow, is built above the upperdeck.
            </p>
            <p>
              Daniel is roused by a rooster on the forecastle* deck that is growing certain it’s not just imagining the light in the eastern sky. Unfortunately the eastern light is off to port this morning. Yesterday it was to starboard. Minerva has been sailing up and down the New England coast for the better part of a fortnight, trying to catch a wind that will decisively take her out into the deep water.
            </p>
          </figure>
          <p>
            The main body text again has a text size of 12 px and a line height of 18 px. The sidenotes are set at 10 px and so their line-height must be increased to 18 ÷ 10 = 1.8.
          </p>
          <h3>
            Images
          </h3>
          <p>
            On the Web, images in sidebars and within the main body of text are almost always guilty of disrupting the rhythm of text. The same rules should be applied to images as to headings: any image and associated caption should take up multiples of the basic line height. For example the image on this page demonstrating asymmetrical headings is 180 px tall – precisely 10 lines in height. 
          </p>
          <p>
            Clearly problems would arise when the basic text size changes, for example if a reader changes their default text size. In this situation, if the image is left at its natural size, or has a specific size set in pixels, the image would no longer take up a multiple of the basic line height. This could be avoided if the image is sized in ems rather than pixels. For example, the aforementioned image could be given a <code>height</code> of 180 ÷ 12 = 15 em (12 px being the text size).
          </p>
          <p>
            Sizing images in ems rather than pixels means that they scale up and down with the text size. It is acknowledged, however that this will result in some loss of image quality which may or may not be acceptable. The alternative is to keep the images sized in pixels, and accept that the small proportion of readers who resize their default text size will receive a sub-optimal reading experience.

          </blockquote>
          <p>
            Paragraphs, and other block level elements, are indented using the <code>text-indent</code> property. To ensure a paragraph is set flush left, the text-indent should be set to zero:
          </p>
          <pre data-lang="CSS"><code>p {

          <p>
            Indenting the first line of a paragraph, or any block element is achieved in <abbr>CSS</abbr> using the <code>text-indent</code> property:
          </p>
          <pre data-lang="CSS"><code>p {
  text-indent: 1em;
}</code></pre>
          <p>
            The preceding rule will indent every paragraph, however we only wish to indent paragraphs that follow another paragraph. To achieve this, an adjacent sibling selector (+) can be used:
          </p>
          <pre data-lang="CSS"><code>p + p {
  text-indent: 1em;
}</code></pre>
          <p>
            Further, the line space between paragraphs which most browsers insert by default should be removed. Browsers create this line break by adding a top and bottom margin to paragraphs; the bottom margin should be removed from all paragraphs, and the top margin removed from those paragraphs which follow another paragraph:
          </p>
          <pre data-lang="CSS"><code>p {
  margin-bottom: 0;
}

p + p {
  text-indent: 1em;
  margin-top: 0;
}</code></pre>
          <p>
            There is no limit to how much you indent by, but you may wish to start by describing a square. This can be achieved by setting your indent to the same value as your line-height.
          </p>
          <p>
            It should be noted that Internet Explorer 6 does not support the adjacent sibling selector. In the above examples, <abbr>IE6</abbr> will not indent any paragraphs, instead paragraphs will be marked with a line break.
          </p>
          <p>
            Indentation is not the only way to indicate a paragraph. The many alternatives include: simple block paragraphs, outdenting, ornamented indents, ornamentation within a continuous stream, or droplines.

            Block Paragraphs
          </h3>
          <p>
            As stated earlier, block paragraphs – paragraphs separated by line breaks – are the default method used by web browsers. As explained in <a href="#Add_and_delete_vertical_space_in_measured_intervals" target="_blank">§2.2.2</a> the margins separating paragraphs should be set equal to the line-height in order that the rhythm of the text is maintained.

          </h3>
          <p>
            Marking paragraphs by outdenting them into the margin is achieved in the same manner as indenting: simply use a negative number for the indent.

            Ornaments
          </h3>
          <p>
            Ornamented indentation, unlike standard indentation, does not necessarily require the use of <code>text-indent</code> to achieve the primary effect (although it can aid clarity). The key to achieving this effect is the use of the <abbr>CSS</abbr> 2.1 <code>:before</code> pseudo-element to specify the ornamentation. The following example would insert a floral heart at the beginning of a subsequent paragraph:
          </p>
          <pre data-lang="CSS"><code>p {
  margin-bottom: 0;
}

p + p:before { 
  content: "\2767"; 
  padding-right: 0.4em;
  margin-top: 0;
}</code></pre>
          <figure id="example-10">
            <p>
              Curabitur bibendum tempus feugiat. Nunc tristique, odio eu tempus sodales, dolor augue feugiat nulla, vitae imperdiet ex ex a felis. Donec a neque ex. Mauris vel sem at justo porttitor efficitur.

              Donec eget congue leo. Nullam maximus viverra urna non volutpat. Aenean sed justo sed urna vehicula feugiat tempus vel purus. Integer lacinia, sem eget sollicitudin porta, ante sem rhoncus nibh, quis dictum dolor nisl ut sapien. 
            </p>
          </figure>
          <p>
            In the above example, applying a <code>text-indent</code> to the paragraph would cause the ornament to be indented with the first line of the paragraph; to separate the ornament from the content, <code>padding-right</code> has been applied to the generated content.
          </p>
          <p>
            Another use of ornaments as paragraph markers is to have a continuous stream of text with paragraphs separated by ornaments. To achieve this, the paragraphs should be set to display as <code>inline</code> elements, with ornamentation specified as before (in this case a decorative pilcrow is used in place of the floral heart bullet):
          </p>
          <pre data-lang="CSS"><code>p { 
  display: inline;
}

p + p:before { 
  content: "\2761"; 
  padding-right: 0.1em;
  padding-left: 0.4em;
}</code></pre>
          <figure id="example-11">
            <p>
              Aenean convallis ipsum at odio dictum ultricies id eget neque. Cras blandit sem sit amet mi vulputate, quis porta dui convallis. Morbi vel nisi non massa commodo rhoncus.

            </p>
          </figure>
          <p>
            It should be noted that the afore mentioned rules for ornaments will not work in Internet Explorer (up to version 7 at the time of writing) as it does not support the <code>content</code> property of <abbr>CSS</abbr>. Additionally Firefox on Windows (tested on <abbr>XP</abbr> SP2 at the time of writing) will only display those ornaments which are contained within the current font. Essentially these limitations imply that the aforementioned technique cannot be relied upon to work on Windows machines at present. Alternative techniques would be to use background image instead, or to include actual images in the code which, if sized in ems, would resize in proportion to the text.
          </p>
          <h3>
            Droplines
          </h3>
          <p>
            Dropline paragraphs start one line down, at the horizontal place on the page that the previous paragraph finished. Unlike other styles mentioned, dropline paragraphs for long pieces of text are impossible to achieve consistently in <abbr>CSS</abbr> without exorbitantly long <abbr>CSS</abbr> files or (preferably) the aid of JavaScript.
          </p>
          <p>
            A technique that can be applied is similar to that used for a continuous stream of text, in that it uses <code>display:inline</code> to achieve the horizontal positioning. Once the paragraphs are positioned horizontally, a relative top position equal to the line height applied to subsequent paragraphs can create the desired vertical positioning (and thus the full drop line effect):
          </p>
          <pre data-lang="CSS"><code>p {
  display: inline; 
  position: relative;
}

p + p {
  top: 1.3em;
}</code></pre>
          <p>
            The problem with this approach is that the vertical positioning is not relative to the previous paragraph, only the parent box, and so all paragraphs after the first dropped paragraph appear to simply be part of a continuous stream of text. To achieve the full effect requires that each subsequent paragraph have a multiple of the original <code>top</code> position:
          </p>
          <pre data-lang="CSS"><code>p {
  display: inline; 
  position: relative;
}

p + p {
  top: 1.3em;
}

p + p + p {
  top: 2.6em;
}

p + p + p + p {
  top: 3.9em;
}</code></pre>
          <p>
            Specifying top positions this way is clearly unwieldy, and a perfectly reasonable candidate for implementing in JavaScript. The technique might be applicable to display material where there are only short runs of text.

            Adding a gap between a block quotation and the main text is best achieved by applying a top and bottom margin to the blockquote. By default, browsers usually apply a left and right margin as well. You may wish to remove this altogether by setting the margins to zero. If you wish to retain the indent, a more consistent layout can be achieved by applying left and right margins equal to the top and bottom margins.

          </blockquote>
          <p>
            When setting verse, whether on the web or otherwise, the primary concern is not to deprive it of its “chosen form”, including matters of spacing and visual structure (as this is considered, in many poetic works, to be at least as important as the words themselves). As such, a <code>pre</code> (pre-formatted) element is most apt to setting verse.
          </p>
          <pre data-lang="HTML"><code>&lt;blockquote class="verse"&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;God guard me from those thoughts men think
In the mind alone;
He that sings a lasting song
Thinks in a marrow bone.&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;</code></pre>
          <p>
            In its default state the <code>pre</code> element is usually rendered using a monospaced font, so this should normally be changed to a more fitting typeface. Setting the <code>font-family</code> to inherit the typeface from the surrounding text may be a good start:
          </p>
          <pre data-lang="CSS"><code>.verse pre {
  font-family: inherit;
}</code></pre>
          <p>
            A logical way to center the verse on the longest line would be to simply specify <code>width:auto</code> and <code>margin:0 auto</code>. Unfortunately, due to browsers’ rendering of preformatted elements, the element will still be considered to comprise full-width lines, so no centering will occur. However we can work around this by specifying the <code>pre</code> element to display as a <code>table</code> as follows:
          </p>
          <pre data-lang="CSS"><code>.verse pre {
  font-family: inherit;
  display: table;
  width: auto;
  margin: 0 auto;
}</code></pre>
          <p>
            The preceding rules achieve the desired layout in Firefox, Safari and Opera 9. However <code>margin:0 auto</code> will not center elements in Internet Explorer 6 or 7, without a specific width being set. To work around this, a new <code>span</code> element containing the entire block of verse must be nested within the <code>pre</code> element as follows:
          </p>
          <pre data-lang="HTML"><code>&lt;blockquote class="verse"&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;God guard me from those thoughts men think
In the mind alone;
He that sings a lasting song
Thinks in a marrow bone.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;</code></pre>
          <p>
            This <code>span</code> can then be centered in Internet Explorer applying <code>text-align:center</code> to the <code>pre</code> and resetting the text alignment on the <code>span</code> element.
          </p>
          <pre data-lang="CSS"><code>.verse pre {
  text-align: center;
}

.verse pre span {
  text-align: left;
}</code></pre>
          <p>
            Much like other browsers, Internet Explorer considers any preformatted content to have full-width lines; to counter this, the <code>span</code> can be set to <code>display:inline-block</code>. This in turn causes Internet Explorer to ignore white-space formatting, so we must re-set the <code>span</code> to <code>white-space:pre</code>. This gives us:
          </p>
          <pre data-lang="CSS"><code>.verse pre {
  text-align: center;
}

.verse pre span {
  text-align: left;
  display: inline-block;
  white-space: pre;
}</code></pre>
          <p>
            The <code>display:inline-block</code> in the preceding rule causes Gecko-based browsers such as Firefox and Camino to incorrectly render the contents. Fortunately these rules are only required for Internet Explorer, so we can write them in a separate style sheet, included using conditional comments (see <a class="ext-link" href="https://www.quirksmode.org/css/condcom.html" target="_blank">Quirksmode</a> for more info):

          <p>
            Unlike much word processing and page-layout software, there is not yet any automatic hyphenation built into web browsers. The next best method is to insert hyphen characters manually.
          </p>
          <p>
            Liquid layouts and resizable text mean that, on the Web, one never knows which word will be at the end of a line. To deal with this in <abbr>HTML</abbr>, there are two types of hyphens: the plain hyphen and the soft hyphen. Browsers treat the plain hyphen as just another character. The soft hyphen tells the browser where a word break can occur, and should only be displayed when a word is being broken across two lines.
          </p>
          <p>
            The soft hyphen has existed since <abbr>HTML</abbr> 3.2, and is <a class="ext-link" href="https://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/struct/text.html#h-9.3.3" target="_blank">explained well in the <abbr>HTML</abbr> 4.0</a> recommendation. Its entity code is <code>&amp;shy;</code> or <code>&amp;#173;</code> and is used as follows:
          </p>
          <pre data-lang="HTML"><code>anti&amp;shy;dis&amp;shy;est&amp;shy;ab&amp;shy;lish&amp;shy;ment&amp;shy;arian&amp;shy;ism</code></pre>
          <p>
            Which renders in your browser as: anti­dis­est­ab­lish­ment­arian­ism.
          </p>
          <p>
            By definition, a soft hyphen should only appear when the word is wrapped. Browser support for this was patchy, but the situation has improved recently. Internet Explorer 6 treats the soft hyphen correctly, as do Opera, Safari 2 and Firefox 3. However older Gecko-based browsers such as Firefox 2 hide all soft hyphens and do not perform any hyphenation. By contrast Safari 1 displays all soft hyphens regardless of whether the word is wrapping.

            The Future

            Until recently, the <a class="ext-link" href="https://www.w3.org/TR/css3-text/#hyphenate" target="_blank"><abrr>CSS</abbr> 3 Text module</a> contained the <code>hyphenate</code> property which could be set to <code>auto</code> or <code>none</code>. This property introduced the concept of automatic hyphenation to browsers, and would require that the web browser has a hyphenation dictionary for the language of the text being hyphenated. For example:
          </p>
          <pre data-lang="CSS"><code>p {
  hyphenate: auto;
}</code></pre>
          <p>

For example:
          </p>
          <pre data-lang="CSS"><code>p {
  hyphenate-before: 2;
  hyphenate-after: 3;
}</code></pre>

            The choice of which hyphenation dictionary to use should be automatic depending on the natural language of the document. The document language should ordinarily be specified in the <abbr>https</abbr> header, but can also be identified with markup:

            The <a class="ext-link" href="https://www.w3.org/TR/css3-text/#hyphenate"><abbr>CSS</abbr> 3 Text module</a> may also introduce a <code>hyphenate-dictionary</code> property to specify which hyphenation dictionary to use. For example:

              Hard spaces are useful for preventing line-breaks within phrases such as <em>6.2 mm</em>, <em>3 in</em>., <em>4 × 4</em>, or in phrases like <em>page 3</em> and <em>chapter 5</em>.”
            </p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>
            In <abbr>HTML</abbr> the hard space character is known as a non-breaking space and is inserted using the entity <code>&amp;nbsp;</code>, for example:
          </p>
          <pre data-lang="HTML"><code>1&amp;nbsp;inch is equivalent to 2.54&amp;nbsp;cm.</code></pre>
          <p>
            It should not really be expected of authors to type <code>&amp;nbsp;</code> everytime a non-breaking space is required. This is a job that, to some degree, can be performed automatically by a content management system. To demonstrate this by way of simple <abbr>PHP</abbr> example, a regular expression function could automatically insert non-breaking spaces as follows:
          </p>
          <pre data-lang="PHP"><code>$search = '/([0-9]) ([a-zA-Z])/';
$replace = '$1&amp;nbsp;$2';
$text = preg_replace($search,$replace,$text);</code></pre>
          <p>
            This function looks for sequences of a number followed by a space followed by a letter and replaces the space with a non-breaking space. This would deal with instances such as <i>2.54 cm</i>. For phrases like <i>chapter 5</i> it would be better to create a set of watch-words rather than attaching every number to a preceding string. Additionally rules would need to be created to handle common mathematical operators as in <i>4 × 4</i>.

          <p>
            Comprehensive control for page breaks was introduced in <abbr>CSS</abbr> 2, however browser support is currently limited to Opera 9. The only paging properties supported by Internet Explorer 7, Safari 3 and Firefox 2 are <code>page-break-before</code> and <code>page-break-after</code> (this is also true of <abbr>IE8</abbr> beta and Firefox 3 beta at time of writing).
          </p>
          <p>
            The <code>page-break-before</code> and <code>page-break-after</code> properties enable you to say that a page break should occur before or after the specified element. The following example starts a new page everytime an <code>h1</code> heading is encountered and after every <code>.section</code> block.
          </p>
          <pre data-lang="CSS"><code>h1 {
  page-break-before: always;
}

.section {
  page-break-after: always;
}</code></pre>
          <p>
            If you know (or can calculate) when a paragraph will be split over two pages, you could achieve some crude widow and orphan control by giving that paragraph a relevant class and forcing a page break before it, for example:
          </p>
          <pre data-lang="CSS"><code>.dontsplit {
  page-break-before: always;
}</code></pre>
          <p>
            In reality that is not a likely situation and would always be problematic if readers set their browsers to print out different size text, or use different size paper, to your assumptions. 
          </p>
          <h3>
            The Future
          </h3>
          <p>
            In essence widow and orphan control is not currently possible for the vast majority of people. However <abbr>CSS</abbr> 2 support will increase with time so if you are writing a print style sheet it is worth considering the properties already specified in <abbr>CSS</abbr> 2.
          </p>
          <p>
            A relative of the <code>page-break-after</code> property mentioned earlier is <code>page-break-inside</code> which stops elements spanning pages. For example you may like to apply this rule to all headings:
          </p>
          <pre data-lang="CSS"><code>h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6 {
  page-break-inside: never;
}</code></pre>
          <p>
          Precise widow and orphan control is also available through the <code>widows</code> and <code>orphans</code> properties. The value of the property is the minimum number of lines which is allowed to be widowed or orphaned. For example you can prevent less than four lines of a paragraph being left behind or printed on a new page using the following:
          </p>
          <pre data-lang="CSS"><code>p {
  widows: 4;
  orphans: 4;
}</code></pre>

            Sizing text in <abbr>CSS</abbr> is achieved using the <code>font-size</code> property. In print, font sizes are specified absolutely, for example setting text at 12 points implies a particular physical height for the printed text. On the web, font sizes can be set absolutely or relatively, and in a number of different units. What’s more, most web browsers enable the reader to resize the text to suit their own reading environment and requirements.
          </p>
          <p>
            For text which is to be printed, the <code>font-size</code> property can and should be used to set in text in points, for example:
          </p>
          <pre data-lang="CSS"><code>p {
  font-size: 12pt;
}</code></pre>
          <p>
            For text which is to be read on screen, the situation is slightly more complicated. Arguably the most appropriate unit is pixels which is a unit relative to the screen resolution. Setting text sizes in pixels gives web designers precision similar to that afforded to print designers. However, Internet Explorer does not allow readers to resize text set in pixels (although <abbr>IE7</abbr> does provide full page zooming), so we need to look to other units.
          </p>
          <p>
            Sizing text using the <code>em</code> unit is the next most appropriate approach. The em is a true typographic unit and was <a class="ext-link" href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/css2em.htm" target="_blank">recommended by the <abbr>W3C</abbr></a> from the outset of <abbr>CSS</abbr>. Ems are a relative unit and act as multipliers based on the text element’s parent element. Thus, if the <code>body</code> of a web page has 16 px text by default, making paragraphs render at 12 px would require setting paragraphs at <code>0.75em</code>.
          </p>
          <pre data-lang="CSS"><code>p {
  font-size:0.75em; /* 16x0.75=12 */
}</code></pre>
          <p>
            One further problem arises with this method: <abbr>IE6</abbr> and <abbr>IE7</abbr> unacceptably exaggerate the smallness and largeness of the resized text. This can be solved by setting a percentage <code>font-size</code> on the <code>body</code>.
          </p>
          <p>
            So choosing from the traditional scale, our final font sizing style sheet could look as follows:
          </p>
          <pre data-lang="CSS"><code>body {font-size: 100%; }
h1 { font-size: 2.25em;  /* 16x2.25=36 */ }
h2 { font-size: 1.5em;   /* 16x1.5=24 */ }
h3 { font-size: 1.125em; /* 16x1.125=18 */ }
h4 { font-size: 0.875em; /* 16x0.875=14 */ }
p  { font-size: 0.75em;  /* 16x0.75=12 */ }</code></pre>
          <p>

          <p>
            Many core web fonts (indeed most digital fonts) ship with only one case of figures: Arial, Comic Sans, Helvetica, Tahoma, Times, Times New Roman, Trebuchet and Verdana all ship with titling figures only. Georgia is the sole holder of text figures (but lacks titling figures).
          </p>
          <p>
            Microsoft’s new ‘C’ fonts however, are very strong with respect to their numerals. All six typefaces (including the fixed-width Consolas) have both titling and text figures included in the base fonts. Further, three of the fonts default to titling figures (Calibri, Cambria, and Consolas), the other three to text figures (Candara, Constantia, and Corbel). Constantia and Corbel even include small variants of their lining figures for use with text set in small capitals.
          </p>
          <p>
            Despite the bright hope for the future brought by Microsoft’s ‘C’ fonts, <abbr>CSS</abbr> currently makes no provision for the control of numeral case, this means the default figures will always be used, regardless of context.

The current <a class="ext-link" href="https://dev.w3.org/csswg/css3-fonts/" target="_blank">editor’s draft</a> includes a proposal for supporting specification of lining or old-style numbers through the <code>font-variant-numeric</code> property.
          </p>
          <p>
            For example, one could specify old-style figures using the <code>oldstyle-nums</code> value as follows:

                This is a good rule for just about everything except two-letter geographical acronyms and acronyms that stand for personal names. Thus: <abbr>3:00 AM</abbr>, <abbr>3:00 PM</abbr>, the ninth century <abbr>CE</abbr>, <abbr>450 BC</abbr> to <abbr>AD 450</abbr>, the <abbr>OAS</abbr> and <abbr>NATO</abbr>; World War <abbr>II</abbr> or <abbr>WWII</abbr>; but JFK and Fr J.A.S. O'Brien, <abbr>OMI</abbr>; <abbr>HMS</abbr> <em>Hypothesis</em> and <abbr>USS</abbr> <em>Ticonderoga</em>; Washington, DC, and Mexico, DF.<br/><span class="bracket">[</span>…<span class="bracket">]</span>

              <p>
                Genuine small caps are not simply shrunken versions of the full caps. They differ from large caps in stroke weight, letterfit, and internal proportions as well as in height. Any good set of small caps is designed as such from the ground up. Thickening, shrinking and squashing the full caps with digital modification routines will only produce a parody.”

            <a class="ext-link" href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/typography/opentype/spec/" target="_blank">OpenType</a> supports the necessary features for this. These are well-supported by <code>font-variant-caps</code> and <code>font-variant-numeric</code> <abbr>CSS</abbr> properties from <a class="ext-link" href="https://www.w3.org/TR/css-fonts-3/" target="_blank">Fonts Module Level 3</a>. These properties have wide support in browsers. The trickier part of applying them is to make sure you are enabling these features on fonts that support these features rather than asking the browser to create the shrunken ‘parody’ versions Bringhust mentions. For example even fonts that support small caps and oldstyle numbers are served without them by Google Fonts.
          </p>
          <pre data-lang="CSS"><code>abbr {
  font-variant-caps: all-small-caps;
  font-variant-numeric: oldstyle-nums;
  font-style: normal;
}</code></pre>
          <p>
            For <code>font-variant-caps</code> the difference between <code>small-caps</code> and <code>all-small-caps</code> is that the former only affects lowercase letters. The latter will convert all text to small caps. <code>font-style: normal</code> is because vanishingly small numbers of fonts provide italicized small caps.

              They can be faked with digital machinery, by sloping the roman small caps, but it is better to choose a face … which includes them, or to live without.”
